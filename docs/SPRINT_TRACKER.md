# Sprint Tracker — SpeakUp Connect

> Last Updated: June 5, 2026  
> Current Sprint: **Sprint 13** (Group Membership Requests) — design complete; implementation not started  
> Sprint Duration: 2 weeks

> **Development Velocity Note:** Development has significantly outpaced the original planned schedule. As of May 23, 2026 (day 5 of the project), the codebase covers work originally scoped for Sprints 1–6. Sprint numbering below reflects original plan order but completion dates reflect actual delivery dates.

## Active Sprint

### Sprint 13 — Group Membership Requests (Join & Leave) *(Epic 2.6.1)*
- **Status:** 📋 Design complete — implementation not started
- **Goal:** Join: members **request to join** when `allowJoinRequests` is on (default off). Leave: `voluntary` (leave anytime) or `request_required` (reason form + approval, default). Alerts when **removed** or **leave denied** (with reason).
- **Design:** [GROUP_JOIN_REQUESTS.md](GROUP_JOIN_REQUESTS.md)
- **Source epic:** [MASTER_TASK_LIST.md → Epic 2.6.1](MASTER_TASK_LIST.md)

#### 🚀 AI Context Prompt
> "Implement Sprint 13 per `docs/GROUP_JOIN_REQUESTS.md`. Join: `allowJoinRequests`, `joinRequests/{userId}`, browse + review. Leave: `memberLeavePolicy` (`voluntary` | `request_required`), `leaveRequests/{userId}`, Leave group vs Request to leave UI. Callables for submit/review/voluntary leave; enhance removal to notify member. Denied leave alerts must include rejection reason."

#### 📋 Scope (ship order)
- [ ] Schema + join/leave entities + repository
- [ ] Cloud Functions + Firestore rules + indexes
- [ ] Admin/leader policy toggles (join + leave) on create/edit group
- [ ] `BrowseGroupsScreen` + join request sheet
- [ ] `MyGroupsScreen` leave / request-to-leave + reason form
- [ ] `GroupMembershipRequestsScreen` (Join | Leave tabs) + badges
- [ ] Membership notifications (removed, leave denied with reason) + help guides

#### 🚫 Out of scope
- Instant self-join without approval
- Class/homeroom enrollment
- Replacing SSLG election workflow

#### MONHS validation
- [ ] SSLG: join closed; leave `request_required`; officer cannot leave without approval
- [ ] Drum and Lyre: open join requests; `voluntary` leave
- [ ] Admin removes member → student receives alert
- [ ] Denied leave request → student alert shows reason

---

### Sprint 11 — Groups & Clubs *(client demo priority)*
- **Status:** ✅ Complete — commit `828738e` and follow-ups
- **Goal:** Stand up org groups end-to-end so admins can create clubs, manage rosters, assign club positions, and members see their groups — unlocking the **group audience** path in Compose Reminder and a credible client demo narrative (e.g. broadcast to Journalism Club).
- **Source epic:** [MASTER_TASK_LIST.md → Epic 2.6](MASTER_TASK_LIST.md)

#### 🚀 AI Context Prompt
> "We are implementing Sprint 11 — Groups & Clubs for SpeakUp Connect. Stack: Flutter 3.44, Riverpod 3.x, go_router, Firebase Firestore. Build the groups feature per Epic 2.6 and `docs/DATABASE_DESIGN.md` (`organizations/{orgId}/groups/{groupId}` + `members` subcollection). Default org: `monhs-ph-001`. Mirror RBAC patterns from classes (`manageGroupRoster` in rules). Compose Reminder already consumes `audienceGroupsProvider` — wire real group CRUD so group-targeted reminders work in-app."

#### 📋 Scope (demo-critical — ship first)
- [x] Domain: `GroupEntity`, `GroupMemberEntity`, `GroupRepository`, `CreateGroupUseCase`, `AddGroupMemberUseCase`, `GetGroupsUseCase`, `GetMyGroupsUseCase`
- [x] Data: `GroupModel`, `GroupMemberModel`, `GroupRemoteDataSource`, `GroupRepositoryImpl`
- [x] Providers: `orgGroupsProvider`, `myGroupsProvider`, `groupMembersProvider` (+ action notifiers)
- [x] Admin `GroupsListScreen` — searchable list of org groups; entry from Settings (admin section)
- [x] Admin `CreateGroupScreen` — name, description, optional club position definitions
- [x] Admin `GroupMembersScreen` — view roster, add member (user search), remove member, assign `leader` vs `member`, assign club position
- [x] `EditGroupPositionRolesScreen` — customize offices (President, Treasurer, etc.) per group
- [x] `positionRoles` on group docs + `positionRoleId` on member docs; SSLG seed defaults
- [x] In-app **Seed Demo Groups** + `scripts/seed_groups.js` (SPJ, Drum and Lyre Corps, SSLG)
- [x] Firestore rules: gate `groups` / `members` writes on `manageGroupRoster` (keep `isAdminOrAbove` as fallback), matching `classes` pattern
- [x] **Student roster:** `AddStudentScreen`, `provisionStudent` Cloud Function, student ID login (ID as password)
- [x] **Response required** on reminders — recipients must respond before dismissing
- [x] In-app help: per-org Member + Admin guides (`docs/help/orgs/{orgId}/`, `assets/help/`, Settings → Help Center; `_default` fallback)
- [ ] Verify Compose Reminder **group audience** picker populates and publishes → members appear in Alerts feed (on-device smoke test)

#### 📋 Scope (stretch — if time remains)
- [ ] `GroupDetailScreen` — group info + member list (no chat/news yet)
- [x] `MyGroupsScreen` — read-only list with role and club position (Settings + Home)
- [x] Home dashboard section for "My Groups & Clubs"
- [ ] Unit test: `CreateGroupUseCase`; widget test: `GroupsListScreen`

#### 🚫 Explicitly out of scope (later sprints)
- Group chat (Epic 2.11)
- News board posts per group (Epic 2.8)
- Bulk member import
- Classes / homeroom management (separate `classes/` collection — not started in app)

#### 👁️ Stakeholder Demo Asset
- **Asset Type:** Screen recording
- **Location:** `./docs/demos/sprint-011-groups.mp4`
- **Stakeholder Note:** Admin creates SPJ / Drum and Lyre / SSLG groups, adds student members; admin broadcasts a reminder to SPJ and recipients see it in Alerts.

#### Next up
- **Sprint 13 — Group Membership Requests (Epic 2.6.1):** join + leave policies — see [GROUP_JOIN_REQUESTS.md](GROUP_JOIN_REQUESTS.md).

---

### Sprint 12 — Reminder Enhancements *(Epic 2.9.1)*
- **Status:** ✅ Complete — deployed to `speakup-connect-891dd`
- **Goal:** Expiration, notification history, broadcast edit/recall, full-screen detail, and optional recipient responses on reminders.
- **Source epic:** [MASTER_TASK_LIST.md → Epic 2.9.1](MASTER_TASK_LIST.md)

#### 📝 Done
- [x] Optional `expiresAt` — date/time picker or hours+minutes duration on compose; `expireReminders` scheduled job
- [x] `notification_history` archive — expired, recalled, dismissed, cleared; history screen for author/admin
- [x] Edit/recall broadcasts — `updateReminder`, `recallReminder` callables; owner + org admin UI
- [x] `BroadcastDetailScreen` — tap reminder for full-screen view with expiration and back navigation
- [x] Optional recipient responses — free text (char limit), checkboxes, multiple choice; `submitReminderResponse` callable
- [x] `ReminderResponsesScreen` — author/admin views aggregated responses per broadcast
- [x] Deployed: `firestore:rules`, `expireReminders`, `dismissNotification`, `clearNotificationFeed`, `submitReminderResponse`

#### Deferred follow-ups
- [ ] On-device smoke test: each response type end-to-end; expiration + history verification
- [ ] Unit/widget tests for response config and forms

#### 👁️ Stakeholder Demo Asset
- **Asset Type:** Screen recording
- **Location:** `./docs/demos/sprint-012-reminder-responses.mp4`
- **Stakeholder Note:** Admin composes a reminder requesting checkbox responses; members open the alert full-screen and submit; admin reviews responses from My Broadcasts.

## Completed Sprints

### Sprint 10 — Reminders Feature
- **Date/Time:** June 1, 2026 (implemented); closed June 8, 2026
- **Status:** ✅ Complete — core scope shipped & deployed; follow-ups deferred (see below)
- **Goal:** Full reminders feature — compose, broadcast delivery (push + in-app feed), optional approval workflow, `approveReminders` permission.
- **Verification:** `flutter analyze` clean; `functions` `npm run build` passes; deployed `firestore:rules`, `firestore:indexes`, and Cloud Functions on `speakup-connect-891dd`.

#### 📝 Done

- [x] `onReminderPublished` + `publishDueReminders` Cloud Functions live
- [x] In-app Alerts feed + approval queue + compose screen with all / group / role audience

#### Deferred follow-ups
- [ ] On-device smoke test: compose → approve → feed entry; scheduled publish *(can run anytime)*
- [ ] **Group audience demo** — in progress via Sprint 11

---

### Sprint 9 — RBAC Phase 2: Permission Enforcement + UX
- **Date/Time:** June 1, 2026
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Commit:** `5f1c4f7` (Sprint 9) + `8997ccc` (bugfixes)

#### 📝 Done
- [x] Router guard: non-admin profiles redirected away from `/admin/*` routes
- [x] `manageRoles` permission gate on RolesManagementScreen FAB, `_RoleCard` edit/assign buttons, `_EmptyRolesPlaceholder` buttons
- [x] `manageReports` permission gate on AdminReportDetailScreen admin actions section

- [x] Photo lightbox viewer (`showPhotoViewer`) added to both report detail screens (admin + user)
- [x] Category chip displayed in both report detail screen headers
- [x] `customCapabilitiesProvider` switched to `FutureProvider` + `get()` to surface Firestore errors
- [x] Deploy Firestore rules for `customCapabilities` collection (fixed permission-denied)
- [x] Fix capabilities screen: `ref.invalidate(customCapabilitiesProvider)` after create and delete
- [x] Add composite index `users(approvalStatus ASC, displayName ASC)` — fixes assign-role user list query
- [x] Add `scripts/assign_admin.js` bootstrap script for org-admin role assignment

---

### Sprint 8 — RBAC: Roles Management, Phase 1
- **Date/Time:** May 29, 2026
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Commit:** `f1b2866`
- **GitHub Issues:** *(pending)*

#### 🚀 AI Context Prompt
> "We are implementing Sprint 8 — RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for SpeakUp Connect. Stack: Flutter 3.44, Riverpod 3.x (NotifierProvider pattern), go_router, Firebase Firestore. Seed 6 default system/starter roles into `organizations/monhs-ph-001/roles`, build the Roles & Permissions management screen, and fix any layout issues. DefaultOrganizationId is `monhs-ph-001`."

#### 📝 Done
- [x] Add `SeedRoles` notifier + `seedRolesProvider` to `roles_provider.dart` — batch-writes 6 roles via `SetOptions(merge: true)`
- [x] Add in-app "Seed Default Roles" button to `_EmptyRolesPlaceholder` (follows `_SetupCategoriesCard` pattern)
- [x] Seed 6 roles to Firestore: `org-admin` (all 14 permissions, isSystemRole), `member` (isSystemRole, no caps), `guidance-counselor`, `discipline-officer`, `homeroom-teacher`, `club-adviser`
- [x] Fix `_RoleCard` layout crash — `AppButton.secondary` uses `minimumSize: Size(double.infinity, 52)` by default; added `minimumWidth: 80` to prevent infinite-width constraint inside `Row`
- [x] Fix global FAB shape — removed `shape: const CircleBorder()` from `FloatingActionButtonThemeData`; Flutter's defaults already give regular FABs a circle and `.extended` FABs a stadium shape
- [x] Add explicit `shape: const StadiumBorder()` to both `FloatingActionButton.extended` widgets (`roles_management_screen.dart`, `my_reports_screen.dart`)
- [x] Make `+N more` capability chip interactive — converted from `Chip` to `ActionChip`; tapping opens `AlertDialog` listing all capabilities for that role

#### 👁️ Stakeholder Demo Asset
- **Asset Type:** *(To be added)*
- **Location:** `./docs/demos/sprint-008-rbac-roles.mp4`
- **Stakeholder Note:** Admins can now view all defined roles (system and custom) in the Roles & Permissions screen, see each role's capability chips, tap "+N more" to reveal the full capability list in a dialog, and use the in-app seed button to bootstrap default roles for a new organisation.

## Completed Sprints

### Sprint 7 — Admin Dashboard Enhancements
- **Date/Time:** May 29, 2026
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Commit:** `9ec4bcd`
- **GitHub Issues:** #43, #44, #45, #46

#### 📝 Done
- [x] Quick stats header — total, submitted, in-progress, resolved counts above the filter bar
- [x] Search bar — title/reference number filter with clear button (`adminSearchQueryProvider`)
- [x] Assign report to admin — "Assign / Reassign" button on detail screen, `_AssignDialog` with admin user picker and search, assignee display in header card
- [x] Push notification on status change — `notifyReporterOnStatusChange` Cloud Function (v2 `onDocumentUpdated`), sends FCM to reporter when `status` changes, respects `notificationPreferences.statusUpdates`, prunes stale tokens

#### 👁️ Stakeholder Demo Asset
- **Asset Type:** *(To be added)*
- **Location:** `./docs/demos/sprint-007-admin-enhancements.mp4`
- **Stakeholder Note:** Admin dashboard now shows live report counts, supports search, allows assigning reports to admin staff, and automatically notifies reporters when their report status changes.

---

### Sprint 6 — Admin Dashboard
- **Date/Time:** May 23, 2026
- **GitHub Issues:** #22, #23, #24, #25, #26

**Goal:** Admin dashboard fully functional: view all org reports, filter by category and status, navigate to full report detail, update status with history, add internal admin notes.

**Sprint Period:** May 22–23, 2026 (accelerated delivery)

#### 🚀 AI Context Prompt
> "We are building the Admin Dashboard feature for SpeakUp Connect. Stack: Flutter 3.44, Riverpod 3.x (NotifierProvider pattern), go_router, Firebase Firestore. The admin can see all reports for their org, filter by category/status, tap a report to see the full detail, update the status (with history append), and add internal admin notes. DefaultOrganizationId is `monhs-ph-001`. Admin UID is `4kuMOm3BZDT9oZpALIDjCnPT8Gk1`."

#### 📝 Done
- [x] Build `AdminDashboardScreen` — tab bar (All / Submitted / In Review / Resolved / Closed), report list, tap-to-detail navigation
- [x] Build `AdminFilterBar` — horizontal multi-select category filter chips (empty set = All; tapping All clears all)
- [x] Apply `adminCategoryFilterProvider` client-side filter to report list
- [x] Build `AdminReportDetailScreen` — full report view: header card (title, ref, status badge, priority badge, submitter, timestamps), description, photo gallery, admin action buttons, notes thread, status history timeline
- [x] Build `_StatusUpdateDialog` — status dropdown + optional note field, calls `updateReportStatus()`
- [x] Build `_AddNoteDialog` — multi-line note entry, calls `addAdminNote()`, resolves author name from `userProfileProvider`
- [x] Wire `adminReportByIdProvider` (FutureProvider.family) for detail data loading
- [x] Auto-refresh detail screen after status update or note via `ref.invalidate(adminReportByIdProvider(reportId))`
- [x] Implement Firestore Security Rules with `isAdminOrAbove()` guard on all report admin operations

- [x] Fix launch color to brand navy `#002673`
- [x] Remove debug logging from settings screen
- [x] Seed report categories for `monhs-ph-001`

#### 👁️ Stakeholder Demo Asset
- **Asset Type:** *(To be added — screen recording of admin dashboard + detail + filter)*
- **Location:** `./docs/demos/sprint-006-admin-dashboard.mp4`
- **Stakeholder Note:** Admins can now fully manage submitted reports — view all, filter by category, update status with audit trail, and add internal notes. All Firestore access is secured by role-based rules.

#### Remaining Sprint 6 Items (deferred to next sprint)
- [ ] Admin dashboard search bar
- [ ] Quick stats header (total, pending, in-progress counts)
- [ ] Assign report to admin personnel
- [ ] Push notification to reporter on status change

### Sprint 13 — Client FCM & Push Notifications *(planned — after Sprint 11)*
- **Status:** 📋 Planned
- **Goal:** Wire `firebase_messaging` on Android so users receive system notifications when the app is backgrounded or closed. Unblocks push delivery for reminders, report status updates, and future broadcasts.
- **Source epic:** [MASTER_TASK_LIST.md → Epic 1.12](MASTER_TASK_LIST.md)
- **Prerequisite:** Sprint 11 Groups complete (demo flow: group reminder → verify push on member device). Server Cloud Functions already call `admin.messaging()` when `users/{uid}.fcmTokens` is populated.

#### 📋 Scope
- [ ] `FcmService` (or `core/notifications/`) — init `FirebaseMessaging`, request permission (Android 13+)
- [ ] On login / app start: get token, `arrayUnion` into `organizations/{orgId}/users/{uid}.fcmTokens`
- [ ] On token refresh: update Firestore; on logout: `arrayRemove` current device token
- [ ] Android notification channels: `reminders`, `status_updates` (IDs already referenced in Cloud Function payloads)
- [ ] Foreground: in-app banner or local notification when message received while app open
- [ ] Background / terminated: tap navigates to `Routes.alerts` or report detail via `data.type` + `reminderId` / `reportId`
- [ ] Respect `notificationPreferences` (`reminders`, `statusUpdates`) before showing local UI (server already skips push when opted out)
- [ ] On-device test: publish group reminder → notification appears in shade without opening app; tap opens Alerts

#### 🚫 Out of scope (defer)
- iOS APNs setup
- Admin FCM topic subscribe/unsubscribe (master list item — evaluate if still needed vs per-user tokens)
- Epic 1.11 new-report admin topic push

#### 👁️ Stakeholder Demo Asset
- **Asset Type:** Screen recording (phone locked → notification arrives → tap → Alerts)
- **Location:** `./docs/demos/sprint-012-fcm-push.mp4`

### Session Log — May 23, 2026 (Branding, Splash, Native Spinner)
- **Date/Time:** May 23, 2026
- **GitHub Issues:** #TBD (tech debt items to be filed)
- **Status:** ✅ Committed — 4 commits pushed to `origin/master` (HEAD = `225a92b`)

#### 📝 Done
- [x] `app_theme.dart` — added `chipTheme`, `switchTheme`, `checkboxTheme`, `radioTheme` so selected state uses `colorScheme.secondary` (#F5DC0F gold) with `colorScheme.onSecondary` for content
- [x] `MainActivity.kt` — moved native `ProgressBar` from `onStart()` to `onCreate()` so spinner appears immediately at app launch (~1s before Flutter engine); removed in `onFlutterUiDisplayed()`
- [x] `splash_screen.dart` — 700ms minimum timer; `_LoadingScreen` (full blue #2563EB Scaffold + white `CircularProgressIndicator`) while loading; `_SplashContent` (branded: logo, "SpeakUp {orgName}", tagline, "Get Started") after
- [x] `app_router.dart` — `_AuthStateListenable` holds off ALL go_router redirects for 5 seconds from app start; ensures authenticated users see splash before redirect to home

#### Known Limitations from This Session
- Launch background color still `#2563EB` (old blue) in `colors.xml` — should be `#002673`. Tracked as tech debt.
- Splash experience (~4s combined blue + spinner) is acceptable but not ideal. Proper fix needs Android SplashScreen API (blocked — see Blocked Items).

#### 👁️ Stakeholder Demo Asset
- **Asset Type:** Device test on Samsung Galaxy S9 (SM-G960U, API 29)
- **Result:** Blue screen ~4s, spinner ~0.5s, branded splash OK. Accepted as interim state.
- **Stakeholder Note:** Branding now fully applied — gold secondary color on all selection widgets; loading experience shows school branding before navigating to home.

*(Sprint 1 in progress — session log entries above represent work completed within Sprint 1 scope and beyond)*

---

## Blocked Items

| # | Item | Reason | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Splash loading experience (timing) | `FlutterSurfaceView` composites independently — native `ProgressBar` doesn't reliably overlay Flutter surface on all devices | Needs Android 12+ SplashScreen API (`androidx.core:core-splashscreen`) or dedicated pre-Flutter Activity. **Do NOT retry** `Handler.postDelayed` or removing `_LoadingScreen` — both failed. |
| 2 | Seed default categories | Needs manual admin action | Admin Dashboard → Branding Settings → "Add Default Categories" for `monhs-ph-001` |

---

## Notes & Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| May 19, 2026 | Use Riverpod 2.x for state management | Best-in-class for Flutter, good DI support |
| May 19, 2026 | Use go_router for navigation | Official Flutter routing package, supports route guards |
| May 19, 2026 | Feature-based folder structure | Scales better than layer-based for long-term SaaS |
| May 19, 2026 | Reference number format: `{ORG_CODE}-{YEAR}-{SEQ}` | Based on wireframe (MONHS-2024-000123) |
| May 19, 2026 | 3-step report submission wizard | Based on wireframe: Details → Photos → Review |
| May 19, 2026 | MONHS as first pilot | Originated by MONHS Student Council President |
| May 20, 2026 | SpeakUp Connect is now a full community communications platform | Added groups, messaging, news board, multi-language, apply-to-join, roster import, etc. |
| May 23, 2026 | 5-second router splash lock via `_AuthStateListenable` | Ensures authenticated users see branded splash (~4s) before auto-redirect to home |
| May 23, 2026 | `_LoadingScreen` approach for pre-content state | Full blue Scaffold matching native launch background — avoids white flash between native and Flutter |
| May 23, 2026 | Native spinner in `onCreate()` not `onStart()` | `onStart()` fires after Flutter engine starts on some devices — `onCreate()` guarantees it appears at cold start |
| May 23, 2026 | Do NOT use `Handler.postDelayed` for splash timing | `FlutterSurfaceView` composites independently; native views don't reliably overlay Flutter surface on S9 (API 29) |
